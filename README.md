# Clima

Clima show you all weather information, just beautifully simple. A series of color bars can tell you at a glance exactly current temperature weather as sunny, cloudy, humidity...


In this app I am implementing the concepts:
* Accessing and using Geolocation
* Alamofire library imported via Cocoapods
* Codable functionality in Swift 4
* Passing data back to a previous ViewController using protocols and delegates
* Working with closures
* Using the model, view, controller paradigm
* Accessing an API with the help of its own documentation
